Project created to broaden my knowledge and understanding of how neural networks and popular machine learning libraries works.

Base of this project is class Tensor, which allows to create neural networks and automatically calculate and update gradients.

Try it yourself:

```sh
bash -c "git clone https://github.com/Wector1/neural_network_from_scratch.git && \
         cd neural_network_from_scratch && \
         cmake -B build                 && \
         cd build                       && \
         make                           && \
         ./ai"
```
